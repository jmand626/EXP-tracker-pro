A ML system that can track and compare different models, and display them together. Download the Colab notebook and run it!

Expected Goals:
1. Set up a full experiment-tracking pipeline — including seeding, data loading, transforms, and model building.

2. Use pretrained models effectively — freeze base layers, replace classifier heads, and train them cleanly.

3. Run a structured series of experiments — vary datasets, transforms, and model configs to compare results.

4. Track everything with TensorBoard — log metrics, visualize experiments, and identify the best model.

5. Deploy the best model — load it back in, run predictions, and test it on custom images.

Expected Completion Time: 1 Week
